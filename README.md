# ACA Shop
This was a project done for the intermediate back-end project. It is a shop that you can view products, select multipule items, reviewing orders, and complete a transaction. This project was built with Symfony back-end and Bootstrap front-end with some migrations and fake data in a database. This was the first project I hosted on AWS with an EC2 and the first project I continually updated GitHub with commits.
